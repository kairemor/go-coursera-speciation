The program has a simple function that prints a string.
This is called from within a loop as 2 goroutines:
go race("Hello")
go race("World")
"Hello" and "World" printed by the goroutines appear at
unreliable intervals, thus containing a race condition.
As you can see, the output is different each time the program is run,
indicating the race condition.
